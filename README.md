**8 Week SQL Challenge Repository**

Welcome to my GitHub repository for the 8 Week SQL Challenge! 
In this repository, I will be documenting my journey through each week's case study, ranging from basic to complex SQL problems. 
This challenge is a fantastic opportunity to improve my SQL skills through practical, real-world scenarios.


**About the 8 Week SQL Challenge**

The 8 Week SQL Challenge is a series of SQL exercises designed by Danny Ma from Data with Danny. Each week, participants tackle a new SQL case study, applying SQL concepts to solve business problems. 
It's a great way to learn SQL or refine existing skills.

Learn more and join the challenge at [8 Week SQL Challenge Website](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/).


**Repository Structure**

• Each week's case study will be documented in its own directory.

• I'll provide SQL scripts, queries, and explanations for each problem.

• Feel free to explore and use these resources for your own learning!
